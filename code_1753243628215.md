        ```yaml
        # litellm_config.yml
        providers:
          azure_openai:
            type: "azure_openai"
            api_base: "https://your-azure-endpoint.openai.azure.com/"
            api_version: "2023-05-15"
            api_key: "AZURE_API_KEY"
          ollama_local:
            type: "ollama"
            base_url: "http://host.docker.internal:11434"
        routes:
          - path: "/v1/chat/completions"
            # If model name starts with "azure:", route to Azure, else to Ollama
            target: "azure_openai" if model.startswith("azure:") else "ollama_local"
        ```
        This config allows a single API endpoint to route requests to either Azure OpenAI or local Ollama based on the model name specified.

## Practical Implementation Examples

### Docker Compose for Open WebUI and Ollama
This `docker-compose.yml` sets up a local Ollama server and the Open WebUI together:
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ollama-data:/root/.ollama # persist models
    command: ollama serve
  webui:
    image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
    depends_on:
      - ollama
    ports:
      - "3000:8080"
    environment:
      OPENAI_API_BASE_URL: "http://ollama:11434" # point WebUI to Ollama service
      OPENAI_API_KEY: "not_used_but_required"
      WEBUI_AUTH: "false" # disable auth for simplicity
    extra_hosts:
      - "ollama:127.0.0.1" # ensure the container can resolve the name (if needed)
volumes:
  ollama-data:
```
After running `docker-compose up`, users can access Open WebUI at `http://localhost:3000` to interact with Ollama models.

### Python Q&A Bot with Ollama and LangChain
This example demonstrates a Q&A bot using Ollama's API and Llama 3.2, integrated with LangChain for structured responses.
```python
# qa_bot.py
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_ollama.llms import OllamaLLM

# Set up the prompt template
template = """Question: {question}
Answer: Provide a clear, concise explanation in plain language."""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

# Initialize the LLM
model = OllamaLLM(model="llama3.2") # Ensure llama3.2 is pulled with Ollama

# Combine prompt and model
chain = prompt | model

# Function to process questions
def answer_question(question):
    response = chain.invoke({"question": question})
    return response

# Test the bot
if __name__ == "__main__":
    question = "What is machine learning?"
    response = answer_question(question)
    print(f"Question: {question}")
    print(f"Answer: {response}")
```
To run this, ensure `ollama run llama3.2` is active and install `pip install ollama langchain langchain-ollama`.

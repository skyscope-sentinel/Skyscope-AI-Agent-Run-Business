## Installation Steps

To set up Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence, follow these steps to install prerequisites and deploy the platform. Two scripts are provided: `01-run-first.sh` for prerequisites and `01-main.sh` for platform setup.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/skyscope-sentinel/Skyscope-AI-Agent-Run-Business.git
cd Skyscope-AI-Agent-Run-Business
```

### Step 2: Run the Prerequisite Script (01-run-first.sh)The 01-run-first.sh script installs all necessary dependencies, including Anaconda3, Python 3, Node.js, Docker, Ollama, kaspad, and required Python packages.Make the script executable:chmod +x 01-run-first.shExecute the script:./01-run-first.shMonitor the installation log:tail -f ~/skyscope_prereq_install.logThis script:Updates the system and installs tools (curl, git, wget, etc.).Installs Anaconda3-2024.06-1 from https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/.Installs Python 3.10, python3-pip, and creates a virtual environment (venv).Installs Node.js v18, npm, Docker, Docker Compose, Ollama with gemma3:1b, and kaspad.Installs Python packages (fastapi, uvicorn, requests, pandas, tensorflow, etc.).Verifies installations and provides instructions for the next step.Step 3: Run the Main Script (01-main.sh)The 01-main.sh script configures and deploys the Skyscope Sentinel Intelligence platform, setting up the frontend, backend, agents, and monitoring.Activate the virtual environment created by 01-run-first.sh:source venv/bin/activateMake the script executable:chmod +x 01-main.shExecute the script:./01-main.shMonitor the setup log:tail -f ~/skyscope-sentinel/logs/setup.logThis script:Verifies hardware (Intel i7 12700, 32 GB RAM).Configures Docker services (frontend, backend, MariaDB, Redis, Vault, Prometheus, Grafana).Sets up the Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, and AI agents.Generates cryptocurrency wallets (Ethereum, Kaspa) and stores credentials in ~/Skyscope_manager.txt.Deploys the platform, accessible at:Frontend: http://localhost:3000API: http://localhost:6000Grafana: http://localhost:3001Step 4: Access the PlatformFrontend: Open http://localhost:3000 in a browser to interact with the platform.API: Test the API health endpoint:curl http://localhost:6000/healthGrafana: View metrics at http://localhost:3001.Credentials: Check wallet addresses and credentials:cat ~/Skyscope_manager.txtStep 5: Verify OperationEnsure Docker services are running:docker psCheck platform logs for errors:cat ~/skyscope-sentinel/logs/platform.logMonitor mining and trading activities in Grafana dashboards.TroubleshootingInstallation Errors: Review logs:Prerequisite log: ~/skyscope_prereq_install.logSetup log: ~/skyscope-sentinel/logs/setup.logDocker Issues: Restart services:cd ~/skyscope-sentinel

``` bash
sudo docker-compose restart
```

### Permission Errors: Run scripts with sudo if needed:

```bash 
sudo ./01-run-first.sh &&
sudo ./01-main.sh
```

**Missing Files: Ensure the repository includes all files generated by 01-main.sh (frontend/, backend/, agents/, docs/).**

**If missing, re-run 01-main.sh.**

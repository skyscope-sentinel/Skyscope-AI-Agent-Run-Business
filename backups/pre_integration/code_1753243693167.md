*   **LangGraph**
*   **CrewAI**
*   **OpenAI Swarm**
*   **AutoGen**
*   **IBM Watsonx.Ai**

**Relevance to Search Task:**
*   **Enterprise Solutions & Automation:** The paper specifically categorizes frameworks for "enterprise solutions" and explores their implications in "financial markets, risk management, and enterprise automation."
*   **Scalability & Performance:** It aims to provide a data-driven evaluation by analyzing quantitative metrics such as latency, throughput, and scalability.
*   **Open-Source Focus:** It includes "open-source frameworks" as a specific categorization, aligning with the user's interest in open-source solutions.
*   **Collaborative AI Systems:** The title itself directly references "collaborative AI agent frameworks."

#### 2. Agentic AI: The building blocks of sophisticated AI business applications

**Source:** Chawla, Chhavi, et al. "Agentic AI: The building blocks of sophisticated AI business applications." *Journal of AI, Robotics & Workplace Automation*, Volume 3 / Number 3 / 2024.
**URL:** [https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/airwa/2024/00000003/00000003/art00001](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/airwa/2024/00000003/00000003/art00001)

This paper, published January 1, 2024, delves into the concept of "agentic artificial intelligence" (agentic AI) as a method to organize large language models (LMs) into workflows that mimic human-like iterative reasoning, particularly to address complex reasoning tasks. It emphasizes "multi-agent collaboration (MAC)" as a core component for sophisticated AI business applications.

**Key Concepts and Pillars of Agentic AI Frameworks:**
The paper outlines four fundamental pillars crucial for agentic AI frameworks:
1.  **Tool Use:** Enabling LMs to access external resources (e.g., search engines) for enhanced accuracy.
2.  **Reflection:** Allowing for self-correction and iterative feedback processes.
3.  **Planning:** Ensuring structured breakdown of complex tasks into manageable steps.
4.  **Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC):** Involving multiple LMs working together on specific subtasks.

**Relevance to Search Task:**
*   **Business Automation & Enterprise Orchestration:** The paper's title explicitly links agentic AI to "sophisticated AI business applications." It also discusses "potential use cases for MAC frameworks," which directly aligns with business automation and enterprise orchestration goals.
*   **Collaborative AI Systems:** Multi-Agent Collaboration (MAC) is highlighted as a core pillar, directly addressing the user's interest in collaborative AI systems.
*   **Distributed Task Management:** The concepts of planning and multi-agent collaboration inherently support distributed task management, where different agents handle specific parts of a larger problem.

### Conclusion

Based on the provided search results, cutting-edge multi-agent swarm frameworks are actively being developed and reviewed for their application in business automation, enterprise orchestration, and autonomous agent coordination. While direct GitHub links to open-source implementations were not provided in these academic paper abstracts, the following frameworks were explicitly mentioned as significant in the field:

*   **LangGraph**
*   **CrewAI**
*   **OpenAI Swarm**
*   **AutoGen**
*   **IBM Watsonx.Ai**

These frameworks are being evaluated for their scalability, performance, and applicability in enterprise solutions, and they embody principles of multi-agent collaboration, tool use, reflection, and planning crucial for sophisticated AI applications. Further investigation would be required to ascertain their current open-source status and availability on platforms like GitHub.

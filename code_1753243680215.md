### Other Notes:

*   **openai/swarm**: This project is marked as "experimental, educational" and has been replaced by the **OpenAI Agents SDK**. While the original `openai/swarm` is not cutting-edge for new development, its conceptual inspiration for lightweight multi-agent orchestration is evident in other frameworks like `swarmgo`. For production use cases, migration to the OpenAI Agents SDK is recommended.

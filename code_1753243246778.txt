PARQUET FILE SCHEMA ANALYSIS:

Based on the github-code.py and github_preprocessing.py analysis:

Expected Schema Fields:
1. content (string) - The actual source code content
2. repo_name (string) - GitHub repository name (e.g., "user/repository")
3. path (string) - File path within the repository (e.g., "src/main.py")
4. license (string) - Repository license (one of 15 supported licenses)
5. size (int32) - File size in bytes
6. copies (int) - Number of copies found (from BigQuery)

Derived Fields (added during loading):
- language (string) - Programming language inferred from file extension
- hash (string) - MD5 hash for deduplication (removed after processing)

File Structure Details:
- Each Parquet file contains ~272-284 MB of compressed data
- Files are sharded with ~1000 MB uncompressed data per shard
- Row groups optimized for batch processing (10,000 records per batch)
- Total dataset: 115M files across 1,126 Parquet files

Data Types for Indexing:
1. Text Fields (for semantic search):
   - content: Full source code (primary search target)
   - repo_name: Repository identifier
   - path: File path (contains filename and directory structure)

2. Categorical Fields (for filtering):
   - language: 32 programming languages
   - license: 15 license types

3. Numeric Fields (for sorting/filtering):
   - size: File size in bytes (0 to 1,048,575 bytes per original query)

4. Structural Fields:
   - File extension (derived from path)
   - Directory depth (derived from path)
   - Repository organization (derived from repo_name)

Indexing Strategy Recommendations:
1. Full-text search index on 'content' field
2. Keyword index on 'path' and 'repo_name' 
3. Categorical indexes on 'language' and 'license'
4. Range index on 'size' field
5. Composite indexes for common query patterns
6. Vector embeddings for semantic code search

Estimated Index Size:
- Full dataset: ~1TB uncompressed
- Text index: ~200-500 GB (depending on tokenization)
- Vector embeddings: ~100-200 GB (depending on embedding size)
- Metadata indexes: ~10-20 GB

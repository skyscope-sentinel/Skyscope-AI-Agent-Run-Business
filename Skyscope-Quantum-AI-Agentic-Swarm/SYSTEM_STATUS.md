## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Development Mode
```bash
cd /path/to/skyscope
source venv/bin/activate
streamlit run app.py
```

### Option 2: macOS App Bundle
```bash
cd /path/to/skyscope
./install_macos.sh
```
This will create:
- `dist/Skyscope Sentinel.app` - macOS application bundle
- `Skyscope Sentinel.dmg` - Distributable disk image

## 📋 System Architecture

### Core Modules
- **app.py** - Main Streamlit application
